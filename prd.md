# 📝 PRD: VoiceCal – AI-Powered Food Logging App

## 1. Overview
**VoiceCal** is a mobile application that enables users to log their food intake using natural language voice commands. The app uses AI and NLP to parse spoken inputs, estimate nutritional values, and seamlessly syncs with third-party health and fitness platforms such as Apple Health, Google Fit, MyFitnessPal, and Fitbit.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional calorie tracking apps are often time-consuming and cumbersome, requiring manual entry and exact measurements. This leads to low adherence and incomplete logs. There is a need for a seamless, voice-first, intelligent logging experience that minimizes friction and maximizes accuracy.

---

## 3. Goals & Objectives
- Enable users to log food using voice alone in natural, unstructured language.
- Leverage AI to:
  - Parse food items.
  - Identify quantities and meal context.
  - Estimate calories and macronutrients.
- Provide daily, weekly, and monthly nutrition summaries.
- Sync data with popular health tracking apps and wearable platforms.
- Maintain high data privacy and security compliance.
